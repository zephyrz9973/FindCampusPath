#Test the behavior when there is a double way between two Nodes

created graph graph3

added node A to graph3
added node B to graph3
added node C to graph3

added edge 5.000 from A to B in graph3
added edge 5.000 from B to A in graph3
added edge 6.000 from C to B in graph3
added edge 6.000 from B to C in graph3
added edge 23.000 from C to A in graph3
added edge 23.000 from A to C in graph3

path from A to C:
A to B with weight 5.000
B to C with weight 6.000
total cost: 11.000

path from C to A:
C to B with weight 6.000
B to A with weight 5.000
