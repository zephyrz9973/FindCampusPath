#This is to test the behavior when one parent have multiple child

#Create a graph
created graph graph1

#Add some nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1
added node n4 to graph1

# Add edges from n1 to others
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n3 in graph1
added edge e3 from n1 to n4 in graph1

#List nodes of the graph
graph1 contains: n1 n2 n3 n4

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n3(e2) n4(e3)
the children of n2 in graph1 are:
the children of n3 in graph1 are:
the children of n4 in graph1 are:
