# This test is to test that edge connect nodes in two ways
# Create a graph
CreateGraph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
AddNode graph1 n1
AddNode graph1 n2

# Add two edge in different direction
AddEdge graph1 n1 n2 e1
AddEdge graph1 n2 n1 e2

# Print the nodes in the graph and the outgoing edges from n1
ListNodes graph1
