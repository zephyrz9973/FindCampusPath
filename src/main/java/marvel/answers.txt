I changed the field of the graph to just be a map that maps parent nodes' edge set to corresponding parentNode.
In this way I can get rid of the unnecessary field to speed up my test. I also deleted the GraphNode class to be just
a string since the name of the node itself can already represent node. Moreover I add the compareTo method to allow the
edge sort by alphabetical order of the child node it is connecting to and if have the same child node then sort according
to alphabetical order of label
