### Total Score: 6/10
- Problem 1: 3/7
    - I would not say that adjacency list runs better in time and space in general. Depends on what you're trying to do
    - What do you mean by matrix have square time complexity. In which operation
    - How is implementation easier with super complex map?
    - You should be implementing on the current spec, not a future one
- Problem 4: 3/3

The below scores are separate:

### Implementation Score: 2/3
- getNodesSet, getEdgesSet, getGraph expose representation

### Design Score: 3/3
- Consider consolidating the fields that you have. The more field you have, the more likely some error is gonna occur (ex. forgot to update one of the fields)

### Testing Score: 3/3
- Consider adding more tests and factoring the tests more
